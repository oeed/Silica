 -- character definition
O 5 2,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25 2,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25,1,4,3.5,3,1,3,2.25
-- the line is split by a space character
-- first letter of each line is the character it represents
-- all sizes and quantities are for a standard 10 pixel high font. (i.e. the maximum y value for a point is 10 and minimum is 1)
-- the second number is the character width using the same 10 pixel scale
-- the line then consists of path definintions
-- each number in a path is split by a comma
-- the first and second numbers are the starting point of the path (x and y respectively)
-- the remainder is a bezier path
