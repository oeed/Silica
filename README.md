Installation
========

First, if you haven't already done so, download LÃ–VE from [their site](https://love2d.org/).

Then [download](http://puu.sh/iWhZy/27bdfcb2a1.zip) the emulator and open the .love file. When it loads the screen will be black, that's normal. Close the emulator for now.

Now download the files from GitHub using the Download ZIP button.

Extract the ZIP and copy the contents of the folder to either ```~/Library/Application Support/LOVE/ccemu/data/0/``` or ```C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\ccemu\data\0\``` depending on your OS. If you're using Linux for some bizarre reason try this path, ```~/.local/share/love/ccemu/data/0/```, otherwise figure it out yourself, it's your penality for doing so ;)

The '0' folder should have lots of files in it, including startup. It shouldn't contain a folder containing the files. It should look like this:
