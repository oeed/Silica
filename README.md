# Silica
The next generation ComputerCraft GUI Framework by oeed

Availablility
=============

Silica isn't available for testing yet and won't be until CraftOS 2.0 is officially released.

If you're super eager you can try [installing](http://puu.sh/mpPy2/131ec3a72a.love) the emulator, but I won't be helping you set that up and it probably won't work anyway.

In the mean time, jump on the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/oeed/Silica) to see the occasional sneak peak!
